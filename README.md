# Bone
directplay lobby project for jedi knight dark forces 2

~~## usage
just download and run Bone.exe **as administrator** _(this is required for DirectPlay to launch JK)_~~

### planned features
- directly host or join JK games via IP address
- automatic host->client transfer of map/patch
- patchcommander-like UI for mixing&matching patches
- global games list (probably hosted from bah.wtf)


### building
- change/set up ur inc/lib paths for directx (locally compiled with dx5.2sdk; not included.. source it urself)
- u MUST run visualstudio as Administrator,  then load the project;  the admin priv crosses over to the debugged application
